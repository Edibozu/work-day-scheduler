# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a Work Day Scheduler that allows the ability to save events during a typical work schedule. It incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to give an interactive experience that will provide the user with all the information possible to be able to accurately plan their work day. The application will provide the current time and date, in a 12-hour format, and has text blocks to add and save comments for every hour. Also, a neat feature within the text block is that they will change color depending on the time, based on whether an event is planned for the past, present, and future, with the hope that the user is never confused about their planning.
